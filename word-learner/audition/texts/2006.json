Exit Ghost.</p><p>Marcellus—: ’Tis gone, and will not answer.</p><p>Bernardo—: </p><p>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:</p><p>Is not this something more than fantasy?</p><p>What think you on’t?</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>Before my God, I might not this believe</p><p>Without the sensible and true avouch</p><p>Of mine own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Marcellus—: Is it not like the king?</p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>As thou art to thyself:</p><p>Such was the very armour he had on</p><p>When he the ambitious Norway combated;</p><p>So frown’d he once, when, in an angry parle,</p><p>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</p><p>’Tis strange.</p><p></p><p>Marcellus—: </p><p>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</p><p>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>In what particular thought to work I know not;</p><p>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</p><p>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</p><p></p><p>Marcellus—: </p><p>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</p><p>Why this same strict and most observant watch</p><p>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</p><p>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</p><p>And foreign mart for implements of war;</p><p>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</p><p>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</p><p>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</p><p>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</p><p>Who is’t that can inform me?</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>That can I;</p><p>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</p><p>Whose image even but now appear’d to us,</p><p>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</p><p>Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,</p><p>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet\u2060—</p><p>For so this side of our known world esteem’d him\u2060—</p><p>Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal’d compact,</p><p>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</p><p>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</p><p>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</p><p>Against the which, a moiety competent</p><p>Was gaged by our king; which had return’d</p><p>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</p><p>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</p><p>And carriage of the article design’d,</p><p>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</p><p>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</p><p>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</p><p>Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,</p><p>For food and diet, to some enterprise</p><p>That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other\u2060—</p><p>As it doth well appear unto our state\u2060—</p><p>But to recover of us, by strong hand</p><p>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</p><p>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</p><p>Is the main motive of our preparations,</p><p>The source of this our watch and the chief head</p><p>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</p><p></p><p>Bernardo—: </p><p>I think it be no other but e’en so:</p><p>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</p><p>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</p><p>That was and is the question of these wars.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.</p><p>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</p><p>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</p><p>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</p><p>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</p><p>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</p><p>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</p><p>Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands</p><p>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</p><p>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</p><p>As harbingers preceding still the fates</p><p>And prologue to the omen coming on,</p><p>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</p><p>Unto our climatures and countrymen.\u2060—</p><p>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</p><p></p><p>Reenter Ghost.</p><p>I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</p><p>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</p><p>Speak to me:</p><p>If there be any good thing to be done,</p><p>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</p><p>Speak to me: Cock crows.</p><p>If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,</p><p>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,</p><p>O, speak!</p><p>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</p><p>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</p><p>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</p><p>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</p><p></p><p>Marcellus—: Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</p><p>Horatio—: Do, if it will not stand.</p><p>Bernardo—: ’Tis here!</p><p>Horatio—: ’Tis here!</p><p>Marcellus—: </p><p>’Tis gone! Exit Ghost.</p><p>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</p><p>To offer it the show of violence;</p><p>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</p><p>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</p><p></p><p>Bernardo—: It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>And then it started like a guilty thing</p><p>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</p><p>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</p><p>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</p><p>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</p><p>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</p><p>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</p><p>To his confine: and of the truth herein</p><p>This present object made probation.</p><p></p><p>Marcellus—: </p><p>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</p><p>Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes</p><p>Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,</p><p>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</p><p>And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;</p><p>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</p><p>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</p><p>So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</p><p>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</p><p>Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</p><p>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</p><p>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</p><p>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</p><p>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</p><p>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</p><p>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</p><p></p><p>Marcellus—: </p><p>Let’s do’t, I pray; and I this morning know</p><p>Where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt.</p><p></p><p>Scene II</p><p>A room of state in the castle.</p><p></p><p>Enter King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand, Cornelius, Lords, and Attendants.</p><p>King—: </p><p>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death</p><p>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</p><p>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</p><p>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</p><p>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</p><p>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</p><p>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</p><p>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</p><p>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,</p><p>Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy\u2060—</p><p>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</p><p>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</p><p>In equal scale weighing delight and dole\u2060—</p><p>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr’d</p><p>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</p><p>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</p><p>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,</p><p>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</p><p>Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death</p><p>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</p><p>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</p><p>He hath not fail’d to pester us with message,</p><p>Importing the surrender of those lands</p><p>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</p><p>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</p><p>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</p><p>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</p><p>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras\u2060—</p><p>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</p><p>Of this his nephew’s purpose\u2060—to suppress</p><p>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</p><p>The lists and full proportions, are all made</p><p>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</p><p>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</p><p>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</p><p>Giving to you no further personal power</p><p>To business with the king, more than the scope</p><p>Of these delated articles allow.</p><p>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</p><p></p><p>Cornelius</p><p>Voltimand—: In that and all things will we show our duty.</p><p>King—: </p><p>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell. Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.</p><p>And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?</p><p>You told us of some suit; what is’t, Laertes?</p><p>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,</p><p>And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</p><p>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</p><p>The head is not more native to the heart,</p><p>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</p><p>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</p><p>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>My dread lord,</p><p>Your leave and favour to return to France;</p><p>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,</p><p>To show my duty in your coronation,</p><p>Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,</p><p>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France</p><p>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</p><p></p><p>King—: Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</p><p>By laboursome petition, and at last</p><p>Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent:</p><p>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</p><p>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</p><p>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son\u2060—</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: Aside. A little more than kin, and less than kind.</p><p>King—: How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</p><p>Hamlet—: Not so, my lord; I am too much i’ the sun.</p><p>Queen—: </p><p>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,</p><p>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</p><p>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</p><p>Seek for thy noble father in the dust:</p><p>Thou know’st ’tis common; all that lives must die,</p><p>Passing through nature to eternity.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: Ay, madam, it is common.</p><p>Queen—: </p><p>If it be,</p><p>Why seems it so particular with thee?</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not “seems.”</p><p>’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</p><p>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</p><p>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,</p><p>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</p><p>Nor the dejected ’havior of the visage,</p><p>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</p><p>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,</p><p>For they are actions that a man might play:</p><p>But I have that within which passeth show;</p><p>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</p><p>To give these mourning duties to your father:</p><p>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</p><p>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</p><p>In filial obligation for some term</p><p>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</p><p>In obstinate condolement is a course</p><p>Of impious stubbornness; ’tis unmanly grief;</p><p>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</p><p>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</p><p>An understanding simple and unschool’d:</p><p>For what we know must be and is as common</p><p>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</p><p>Why should we in our peevish opposition</p><p>Take it to heart? Fie! ’tis a fault to heaven,</p><p>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</p><p>To reason most absurd; whose common theme</p><p>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</p><p>From the first corse till he that died to-day,</p><p>“This must be so.” We pray you, throw to earth</p><p>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</p><p>As of a father: for let the world take note,</p><p>You are the most immediate to our throne;</p><p>And with no less nobility of love</p><p>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</p><p>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</p><p>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</p><p>It is most retrograde to our desire:</p><p>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</p><p>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</p><p>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</p><p></p><p>Queen—: </p><p>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:</p><p>I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</p><p>King—: </p><p>Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply:</p><p>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;</p><p>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet</p><p>Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,</p><p>No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,</p><p>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</p><p>And the king’s rouse the heavens shall bruit again,</p><p>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. Exeunt all but Hamlet.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,</p><p>Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!</p><p>Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d</p><p>His canon ’gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!</p><p>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,</p><p>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</p><p>Fie on’t! ah fie! ’tis an unweeded garden,</p><p>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</p><p>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!</p><p>But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:</p><p>So excellent a king; that was, to this,</p><p>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother</p><p>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</p><p>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!</p><p>Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,</p><p>As if increase of appetite had grown</p><p>By what it fed on: and yet, within a month\u2060—</p><p>Let me not think on’t\u2060—Frailty, thy name is woman!\u2060—</p><p>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</p><p>With which she follow’d my poor father’s body,</p><p>Like Niobe, all tears:\u2060—why she, even she\u2060—</p><p>O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,</p><p>Would have mourn’d longer\u2060—married with my uncle,</p><p>My father’s brother, but no more like my father</p><p>Than I to Hercules: within a month:</p><p>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</p><p>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</p><p>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post</p><p>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</p><p>It is not nor it cannot come to good:</p><p>But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.</p><p></p><p>Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.</p><p>Horatio—: Hail to your lordship!</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>I am glad to see you well:</p><p>Horatio\u2060—or I do forget myself.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Sir, my good friend; I’ll change that name with you:</p><p>And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?</p><p>Marcellus?</p><p></p><p>Marcellus—: My good lord\u2060—</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.</p><p>But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: A truant disposition, good my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>I would not hear your enemy say so,</p><p>Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,</p><p>To make it truster of your own report</p><p>Against yourself: I know you are no truant.</p><p>But what is your affair in Elsinore?</p><p>We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;</p><p>I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats</p><p>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.</p><p>Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven</p><p>Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!</p><p>My father!\u2060—methinks I see my father.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: Where, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: In my mind’s eye, Horatio.</p><p>Horatio—: I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>He was a man, take him for all in all,</p><p>I shall not look upon his like again.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</p><p>Hamlet—: Saw? who?</p><p>Horatio—: My lord, the king your father.</p><p>Hamlet—: The king my father!</p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>Season your admiration for a while</p><p>With an attent ear, till I may deliver,</p><p>Upon the witness of these gentlemen,</p><p>This marvel to you.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: For God’s love, let me hear.</p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</p><p>Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,</p><p>In the dead vast and middle of the night,</p><p>Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,</p><p>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,</p><p>Appears before them, and with solemn march</p><p>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d</p><p>By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,</p><p>Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d</p><p>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</p><p>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</p><p>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;</p><p>And I with them the third night kept the watch:</p><p>Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time,</p><p>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</p><p>The apparition comes: I knew your father;</p><p>These hands are not more like.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: But where was this?</p><p>Marcellus—: My lord, upon the platform where we watch’d.</p><p>Hamlet—: Did you not speak to it?</p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>My lord, I did;</p><p>But answer made it none: yet once methought</p><p>It lifted up its head and did address</p><p>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</p><p>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</p><p>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</p><p>And vanish’d from our sight.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: ’Tis very strange.</p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true;</p><p>And we did think it writ down in our duty</p><p>To let you know of it.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.</p><p>Hold you the watch to-night?</p><p></p><p>Marcellus</p><p>Bernardo—: We do, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Arm’d, say you?</p><p>Marcellus</p><p>Bernardo—: Arm’d, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: From top to toe?</p><p>Marcellus</p><p>Bernardo—: My lord, from head to foot.</p><p>Hamlet—: Then saw you not his face?</p><p>Horatio—: O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</p><p>Hamlet—: What, look’d he frowningly?</p><p>Horatio—: A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</p><p>Hamlet—: Pale or red?</p><p>Horatio—: Nay, very pale.</p><p>Hamlet—: And fix’d his eyes upon you?</p><p>Horatio—: Most constantly.</p><p>Hamlet—: I would I had been there.</p><p>Horatio—: It would have much amazed you.</p><p>Hamlet—: Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?</p><p>Horatio—: While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.</p><p>Marcellus</p><p>Bernardo—: Longer, longer.</p><p>Horatio—: Not when I saw’t.</p><p>Hamlet—: His beard was grizzled\u2060—no?</p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>It was, as I have seen it in his life,</p><p>A sable silver’d.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>I will watch to-night;</p><p>Perchance ’twill walk again.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: I warrant it will.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>If it assume my noble father’s person,</p><p>I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape</p><p>And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,</p><p>If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,</p><p>Let it be tenable in your silence still;</p><p>And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,</p><p>Give it an understanding, but no tongue:</p><p>I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:</p><p>Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve,</p><p>I’ll visit you.</p><p></p><p>All—: Our duty to your honour.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Your loves, as mine to you: farewell. Exeunt all but Hamlet.</p><p>My father’s spirit in arms! all is not well;</p><p>I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!</p><p>Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,</p><p>Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.

Perhaps he loves you now,</p><p>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</p><p>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</p><p>His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own;</p><p>For he himself is subject to his birth:</p><p>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</p><p>Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</p><p>The safety and health of this whole state;</p><p>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</p><p>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</p><p>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</p><p>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</p><p>As he in his particular act and place</p><p>May give his saying deed; which is no further</p><p>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</p><p>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,</p><p>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</p><p>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</p><p>To his unmaster’d importunity.</p><p>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</p><p>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</p><p>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</p><p>The chariest maid is prodigal enough,</p><p>If she unmask her beauty to the moon:</p><p>Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes:</p><p>The canker galls the infants of the spring,</p><p>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,</p><p>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</p><p>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</p><p>Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:</p><p>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p><p></p><p>Ophelia—: </p><p>I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,</p><p>As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,</p><p>Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,</p><p>Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;</p><p>Whiles, like a puff’d and reckless libertine,</p><p>Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,</p><p>And recks not his own rede.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>O, fear me not.</p><p>I stay too long: but here my father comes.</p><p></p><p>Enter Polonius.</p><p>A double blessing is a double grace;</p><p>Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!</p><p>The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,</p><p>And you are stay’d for.

I do know,</p><p>When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</p><p>Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,</p><p>Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,</p><p>Even in their promise, as it is a-making,</p><p>You must not take for fire. From this time</p><p>Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;</p><p>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</p><p>Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,</p><p>Believe so much in him, that he is young,</p><p>And with a larger tether may he walk</p><p>Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</p><p>Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,</p><p>Not of that dye which their investments show,</p><p>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</p><p>Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,</p><p>The better to beguile. This is for all:</p><p>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,</p><p>Have you so slander any moment leisure,</p><p>As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.</p><p>Look to’t, I charge you: come your ways.</p><p></p><p>Ophelia—: I shall obey, my lord.

Look you, sir,</p><p>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</p><p>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</p><p>What company, at what expense; and finding</p><p>By this encompassment and drift of question</p><p>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</p><p>Than your particular demands will touch it:</p><p>Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him;</p><p>As thus, “I know his father and his friends,</p><p>And in part him:” do you mark this, Reynaldo?</p><p></p><p>Reynaldo—: Ay, very well, my lord.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>“And in part him; but” you may say “not well:</p><p>But, if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild;</p><p>Addicted so-and-so:” and there put on him</p><p>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</p><p>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</p><p>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</p><p>As are companions noted and most known</p><p>To youth and liberty.</p><p></p><p>Reynaldo—: As gaming, my lord.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</p><p>Drabbing: you may go so far.</p><p></p><p>Reynaldo—: My lord, that would dishonour him.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>’Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.</p><p>You must not put another scandal on him,</p><p>That he is open to incontinency;</p><p>That’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</p><p>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</p><p>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</p><p>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</p><p>Of general assault.</p><p></p><p>Reynaldo—: But, my good lord\u2060—</p><p>Polonius—: Wherefore should you do this?</p><p>Reynaldo—: </p><p>Ay, my lord,</p><p>I would know that.</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Marry, sir, here’s my drift;</p><p>And, I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</p><p>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</p><p>As ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ the working,</p><p>Mark you,</p><p>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</p><p>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</p><p>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</p><p>He closes with you in this consequence;</p><p>“Good sir,” or so, or “friend,” or “gentleman,”</p><p>According to the phrase or the addition</p><p>Of man and country.</p><p></p><p>Reynaldo—: Very good, my lord.</p><p>Polonius—: And then, sir, does he this\u2060—he does\u2060—what was I about to say? By the mass, I was about to say something: where did I leave?</p><p>Reynaldo—: At “closes in the consequence,” at “friend or so,” and “gentleman.”</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>At “closes in the consequence,” ay, marry;</p><p>He closes thus: “I know the gentleman;</p><p>I saw him yesterday, or t’ other day,</p><p>Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</p><p>There was a’ gaming; there o’ertook in’s rouse;</p><p>There falling out at tennis:” or perchance,</p><p>“I saw him enter such a house of sale,”</p><p>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</p><p>See you now;</p><p>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</p><p>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</p><p>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</p><p>By indirections find directions out:</p><p>So by my former lecture and advice,</p><p>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</p><p></p><p>Reynaldo—: My lord, I have.</p><p>Polonius—: God be wi’ you; fare you well.</p><p>Reynaldo—: Good my lord!</p><p>Polonius—: Observe his inclination in yourself.</p><p>Reynaldo—: I shall, my lord.</p><p>Polonius—: And let him ply his music.</p><p>Reynaldo—: Well, my lord.</p><p>Polonius—: Farewell! Exit Reynaldo.</p><p>Enter Ophelia.</p><p>How now, Ophelia! what’s the matter?</p><p>Ophelia—: O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</p><p>Polonius—: With what, i’ the name of God?</p><p>Ophelia—: </p><p>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</p><p>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</p><p>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul’d,</p><p>Ungarter’d, and down-gyved to his ankle;</p><p>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</p><p>And with a look so piteous in purport</p><p>As if he had been loosed out of hell</p><p>To speak of horrors\u2060—he comes before me.</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: Mad for thy love?</p><p>Ophelia—: </p><p>My lord, I do not know;</p><p>But truly, I do fear it.</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: What said he?</p><p>Ophelia—: </p><p>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</p><p>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</p><p>And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow,</p><p>He falls to such perusal of my face</p><p>As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so;</p><p>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</p><p>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</p><p>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</p><p>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</p><p>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</p><p>And, with his head over his shoulder turn’d,</p><p>He seem’d to find his way without his eyes;</p><p>For out o’ doors he went without their helps,</p><p>And, to the last, bended their light on me.</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</p><p>This is the very ecstasy of love,</p><p>Whose violent property fordoes itself</p><p>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</p><p>As oft as any passion under heaven</p><p>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</p><p>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</p><p></p><p>Ophelia—: </p><p>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</p><p>I did repel his letters and denied</p><p>His access to me.</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>That hath made him mad.</p><p>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</p><p>I had not quoted him: I fear’d he did but trifle,</p><p>And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!</p><p>By heaven, it is as proper to our age</p><p>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</p><p>As it is common for the younger sort</p><p>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</p><p>This must be known; which, being kept close, might move</p><p>More grief to hide than hate to utter love. Exeunt.</p><p></p><p>Scene II</p><p>A room in the castle.</p><p></p><p>Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants.</p><p>King—: </p><p>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</p><p>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</p><p>The need we have to use you did provoke</p><p>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</p><p>Of Hamlet’s transformation; so call it,</p><p>Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man</p><p>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</p><p>More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him</p><p>So much from the understanding of himself,</p><p>I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,</p><p>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</p><p>And sith so neighbour’d to his youth and havior,</p><p>That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court</p><p>Some little time: so by your companies</p><p>To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,</p><p>So much as from occasion you may glean,</p><p>Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,</p><p>That, open’d, lies within our remedy.</p><p></p><p>Queen—: </p><p>Good gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you;</p><p>And sure I am two men there are not living</p><p>To whom he more adheres. If it will please you</p><p>To show us so much gentry and good will</p><p>As to expend your time with us awhile,</p><p>For the supply and profit of our hope,</p><p>Your visitation shall receive such thanks</p><p>As fits a king’s remembrance.</p><p></p><p>Rosencrantz—: </p><p>Both your majesties</p><p>Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,</p><p>Put your dread pleasures more into command</p><p>Than to entreaty.</p><p></p><p>Guildenstern—: </p><p>But we both obey,</p><p>And here give up ourselves, in the full bent</p><p>To lay our service freely at your feet,</p><p>To be commanded.</p><p></p><p>King—: Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</p><p>Queen—: </p><p>Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:</p><p>And I beseech you instantly to visit</p><p>My too much changed son. Go, some of you,</p><p>And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</p><p></p><p>Guildenstern—: </p><p>Heavens make our presence and our practices</p><p>Pleasant and helpful to him!</p><p></p><p>Queen—: Ay, amen! Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants.</p><p>Enter Polonius.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,</p><p>Are joyfully return’d.</p><p></p><p>King—: Thou still hast been the father of good news.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,</p><p>I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,</p><p>Both to my God and to my gracious king:</p><p>And I do think, or else this brain of mine</p><p>Hunts not the trail of policy so sure</p><p>As it hath used to do, that I have found</p><p>The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.</p><p></p><p>King—: O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Give first admittance to the ambassadors;</p><p>My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. Exit Polonius.</p><p>He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found</p><p>The head and source of all your son’s distemper.</p><p></p><p>Queen—: </p><p>I doubt it is no other but the main;</p><p>His father’s death, and our o’erhasty marriage.</p><p></p><p>King—: Well, we shall sift him.</p><p>Reenter Polonius, with Voltimand and Cornelius.</p><p>Welcome, my good friends!</p><p>Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</p><p></p><p>Voltimand—: </p><p>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</p><p>Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</p><p>His nephew’s levies; which to him appear’d</p><p>To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack;</p><p>But, better look’d into, he truly found</p><p>It was against your highness: whereat grieved,</p><p>That so his sickness, age and impotence</p><p>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests</p><p>On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;</p><p>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine</p><p>Makes vow before his uncle never more</p><p>To give the assay of arms against your majesty.</p><p>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</p><p>Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,</p><p>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</p><p>So levied as before, against the Polack:</p><p>With an entreaty, herein further shown, Giving a paper.</p><p>That it might please you to give quiet pass</p><p>Through your dominions for this enterprise,</p><p>On such regards of safety and allowance</p><p>As therein are set down.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>It likes us well;</p><p>And at our more consider’d time well read,</p><p>Answer, and think upon this business.</p><p>Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:</p><p>Go to your rest; at night we’ll feast together:</p><p>Most welcome home! Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>This business is well ended.</p><p>My liege, and madam, to expostulate</p><p>What majesty should be, what duty is,</p><p>Why day is day, night night, and time is time,</p><p>Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.</p><p>Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</p><p>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</p><p>I will be brief: your noble son is mad:</p><p>Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,</p><p>What is’t but to be nothing else but mad?</p><p>But let that go.</p><p></p><p>Queen—: More matter, with less art.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</p><p>That he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity;</p><p>And pity ’tis ’tis true: a foolish figure;</p><p>But farewell it, for I will use no art.</p><p>Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains</p><p>That we find out the cause of this effect,</p><p>Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</p><p>For this effect defective comes by cause:</p><p>Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.</p><p>Perpend.</p><p>I have a daughter\u2060—have while she is mine\u2060—</p><p>Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,</p><p>Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise. Reads.</p><p></p><p>“To the celestial and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia,”\u2060—</p><p></p><p>That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; “beautified” is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus: Reads.</p><p></p><p>“In her excellent white bosom, these, etc.”</p><p></p><p>Queen—: Came this from Hamlet to her?</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. Reads.</p><p></p><p>“Doubt thou the stars are fire;</p><p>Doubt that the sun doth move;</p><p>Doubt truth to be a liar;</p><p>But never doubt I love.</p><p></p><p>“O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.</p><p></p><p>“Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet.”</p><p></p><p>This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,</p><p>And more above, hath his solicitings,</p><p>As they fell out by time, by means and place,</p><p>All given to mine ear.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>But how hath she</p><p>Received his love?</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: What do you think of me?</p><p>King—: As of a man faithful and honourable.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>I would fain prove so. But what might you think,</p><p>When I had seen this hot love on the wing\u2060—</p><p>As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</p><p>Before my daughter told me\u2060—what might you,</p><p>Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,</p><p>If I had play’d the desk or table-book,</p><p>Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,</p><p>Or look’d upon this love with idle sight;</p><p>What might you think? No, I went round to work,</p><p>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:</p><p>“Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;</p><p>This must not be:” and then I precepts gave her,</p><p>That she should lock herself from his resort,</p><p>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.</p><p>Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;</p><p>And he, repulsed\u2060—a short tale to make\u2060—</p><p>Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,</p><p>Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,</p><p>Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,</p><p>Into the madness wherein now he raves,</p><p>And all we mourn for.</p><p></p><p>King—: Do you think ’tis this?</p><p>Queen—: It may be, very likely.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Hath there been such a time\u2060—I’d fain know that\u2060—</p><p>That I have positively said “ ’Tis so,”</p><p>When it proved otherwise?</p><p></p><p>King—: Not that I know.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Pointing to his head and shoulder. Take this from this, if this be otherwise:</p><p>If circumstances lead me, I will find</p><p>Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed</p><p>Within the centre.</p><p></p><p>King—: How may we try it further?</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>You know, sometimes he walks four hours together</p><p>Here in the lobby.</p><p></p><p>Queen—: So he does indeed.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him:</p><p>Be you and I behind an arras then;</p><p>Mark the encounter: if he love her not</p><p>And be not from his reason fall’n thereon,</p><p>Let me be no assistant for a state,</p><p>But keep a farm and carters.</p><p></p><p>King—: We will try it.</p><p>Queen—: But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.</p><p>Polonius—: </p><p>Away, I do beseech you, both away:</p><p>I’ll board him presently. Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.</p><p></p><p>Enter Hamlet, reading.</p><p>O, give me leave:</p><p>How does my good Lord Hamlet?</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: Well, God-a-mercy.</p><p>Polonius—: Do you know me, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.</p><p>Polonius—: Not I, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Then I would you were so honest a man.</p><p>Polonius—: Honest, my lord!</p><p>Hamlet—: Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.</p><p>Polonius—: That’s very true, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god kissing carrion\u2060—Have you a daughter?</p><p>Polonius—: I have, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Let her not walk i’ the sun: conception is a blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to’t.</p><p>Polonius—: Aside. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I’ll speak to him again. What do you read, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: Words, words, words.</p><p>Polonius—: What is the matter, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: Between who?</p><p>Polonius—: I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.</p><p>Polonius—: Aside. Though this be madness, yet there is method in’t. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: Into my grave.</p><p>Polonius—: Indeed, that is out o’ the air. Aside. How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.\u2060—My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.</p><p>Hamlet—: You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal: except my life, except my life, except my life.</p><p>Polonius—: Fare you well, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: These tedious old fools!</p><p>Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p><p>Polonius—: You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: To Polonius. God save you, sir! Exit Polonius.</p><p>Guildenstern—: My honoured lord!</p><p>Rosencrantz—: My most dear lord!</p><p>Hamlet—: My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: As the indifferent children of the earth.</p><p>Guildenstern—: </p><p>Happy, in that we are not over-happy;</p><p>On fortune’s cap we are not the very button.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: Nor the soles of her shoe?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Neither, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?</p><p>Guildenstern—: ’Faith, her privates we.</p><p>Hamlet—: In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What’s the news?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.</p><p>Hamlet—: Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true. Let me question more in particular: what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?</p><p>Guildenstern—: Prison, my lord!</p><p>Hamlet—: Denmark’s a prison.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Then is the world one.</p><p>Hamlet—: A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ the worst.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: We think not so, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Why, then, ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Why then, your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for your mind.</p><p>Hamlet—: O God, I could be bounded in a nut-shell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.</p><p>Guildenstern—: Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p><p>Hamlet—: A dream itself is but a shadow.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.</p><p>Hamlet—: Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.</p><p>Rosencrantz</p><p>Guildenstern—: We’ll wait upon you.</p><p>Hamlet—: No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.</p><p>Hamlet—: Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</p><p>Guildenstern—: What should we say, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: To what end, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Aside to Guildenstern. What say you?</p><p>Hamlet—: Aside. Nay, then, I have an eye of you.\u2060—If you love me, hold not off.</p><p>Guildenstern—: My lord, we were sent for.</p><p>Hamlet—: I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather. I have of late\u2060—but wherefore I know not\u2060—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</p><p>Hamlet—: Why did you laugh then, when I said “man delights not me”?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming, to offer you service.</p><p>Hamlet—: He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o’ the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for’t. What players are they?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city.</p><p>Hamlet—: How chances it they travel? their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.</p><p>Hamlet—: Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? are they so followed?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: No, indeed, are they not.</p><p>Hamlet—: How comes it? do they grow rusty?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for’t: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages\u2060—so they call them\u2060—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</p><p>Hamlet—: What, are they children? who maintains ’em? how are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players\u2060—as it is most like, if their means are no better\u2060—their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: ’Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.</p><p>Hamlet—: Is’t possible?</p><p>Guildenstern—: O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</p><p>Hamlet—: Do the boys carry it away?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.</p><p>Hamlet—: It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. Flourish of trumpets within.</p><p>Guildenstern—: There are the players.</p><p>Hamlet—: Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.</p><p>Guildenstern—: In what, my dear lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.</p><p>Reenter Polonius.</p><p>Polonius—: Well be with you, gentlemen!</p><p>Hamlet—: Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Happily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.</p><p>Hamlet—: I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. You say right, sir: o’ Monday morning; ’twas so indeed.</p><p>Polonius—: My lord, I have news to tell you.</p><p>Hamlet—: My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome\u2060—</p><p>Polonius—: The actors are come hither, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Buz, buz!</p><p>Polonius—: Upon mine honour\u2060—</p><p>Hamlet—: Then came each actor on his ass\u2060—</p><p>Polonius—: The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.</p><p>Hamlet—: O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!</p><p>Polonius—: What a treasure had he, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Why,</p><p></p><p>“One fair daughter and no more,</p><p>The which he loved passing well.”</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: Aside. Still on my daughter.</p><p>Hamlet—: Am I not i’ the right, old Jephthah?</p><p>Polonius—: If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.</p><p>Hamlet—: Nay, that follows not.</p><p>Polonius—: What follows, then, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Why,</p><p></p><p>“As by lot, God wot,”</p><p></p><p>and then, you know,</p><p></p><p>“It came to pass, as most like it was,”\u2060—</p><p></p><p>the first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look, where my abridgement comes.</p><p></p><p>Enter four or five Players.</p><p>You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! thy face is valanced since I saw thee last: comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at any thing we see: we’ll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech.</p><p>First Player—: What speech, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; ’twas caviare to the general: but it was\u2060—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine\u2060—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved: ’twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see\u2060—</p><p></p><p>“The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,”</p><p></p><p>—it is not so:\u2060—it begins with Pyrrhus:\u2060—</p><p></p><p>“The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</p><p>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</p><p>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,</p><p>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d</p><p>With heraldry more dismal; head to foot</p><p>Now is he total gules; horridly trick’d</p><p>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</p><p>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,</p><p>That lend a tyrannous and damned light</p><p>To their lord’s murder: roasted in wrath and fire,</p><p>And thus o’er-sized with coagulate gore,</p><p>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</p><p>Old grandsire Priam seeks.”</p><p></p><p>So, proceed you.</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: ’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.</p><p>First Player—: </p><p>“Anon he finds him</p><p>Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,</p><p>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</p><p>Repugnant to command: unequal match’d,</p><p>Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;</p><p>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</p><p>The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</p><p>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</p><p>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</p><p>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear: for, lo! his sword,</p><p>Which was declining on the milky head</p><p>Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ the air to stick:</p><p>So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,</p><p>And like a neutral to his will and matter,</p><p>Did nothing.</p><p>But, as we often see, against some storm,</p><p>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</p><p>The bold winds speechless and the orb below</p><p>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</p><p>Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus’ pause,</p><p>Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;</p><p>And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall</p><p>On Mars’s armour forged for proof eterne</p><p>With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword</p><p>Now falls on Priam.</p><p>Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,</p><p>In general synod take away her power;</p><p>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</p><p>And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,</p><p>As low as to the fiends!”</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: This is too long.</p><p>Hamlet—: It shall to the barber’s, with your beard. Prithee, say on: he’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.</p><p>First Player—: “But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen\u2060—”</p><p>Hamlet—: “The mobled queen?”</p><p>Polonius—: That’s good; “mobled queen” is good.</p><p>First Player—: </p><p>“Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames</p><p>With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head</p><p>Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,</p><p>About her lank and all o’er-teemed loins,</p><p>A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;</p><p>Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep’d,</p><p>’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounced:</p><p>But if the gods themselves did see her then</p><p>When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport</p><p>In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,</p><p>The instant burst of clamour that she made,</p><p>Unless things mortal move them not at all,</p><p>Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,</p><p>And passion in the gods.”</p><p></p><p>Polonius—: Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in’s eyes. Pray you, no more.</p><p>Hamlet—: ’Tis well; I’ll have thee speak out the rest soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.</p><p>Polonius—: My lord, I will use them according to their desert.</p><p>Hamlet—: God’s bodykins, man, much better: use every man after his desert, and who should ’scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.</p><p>Polonius—: Come, sirs.</p><p>Hamlet—: Follow him, friends: we’ll hear a play to-morrow. Exit Polonius with all the Players but the First. Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the Murder of Gonzago?</p><p>First Player—: Ay, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: We’ll ha’t to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in’t, could you not?</p><p>First Player—: Ay, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him not. Exit First Player.

Now I am alone.</p><p>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</p><p>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</p><p>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</p><p>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</p><p>That from her working all his visage wann’d,</p><p>Tears in his eyes, distraction in’s aspect,</p><p>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</p><p>With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!</p><p>For Hecuba!</p><p>What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</p><p>That he should weep for her? What would he do,</p><p>Had he the motive and the cue for passion</p><p>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears</p><p>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,</p><p>Make mad the guilty and appal the free,</p><p>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed</p><p>The very faculties of eyes and ears.</p><p>Yet I,</p><p>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,</p><p>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</p><p>And can say nothing; no, not for a king,</p><p>Upon whose property and most dear life</p><p>A damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?</p><p>Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?</p><p>Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?</p><p>Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ the throat,</p><p>As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?</p><p>Ha!</p><p>’Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be</p><p>But I am pigeon-liver’d and lack gall</p><p>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</p><p>I should have fatted all the region kites</p><p>With this slave’s offal: bloody, bawdy villain!</p><p>Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!</p><p>O, vengeance!</p><p>Why, what an ass am I!

I’ll have these players</p><p>Play something like the murder of my father</p><p>Before mine uncle: I’ll observe his looks;</p><p>I’ll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,</p><p>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</p><p>May be the devil: and the devil hath power</p><p>To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps</p><p>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</p><p>As he is very potent with such spirits,</p><p>Abuses me to damn me: I’ll have grounds</p><p>More relative than this: the play’s the thing</p><p>Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.

To die: to sleep;</p><p>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</p><p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</p><p>That flesh is heir to, ’tis a consummation</p><p>Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;</p><p>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;</p><p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</p><p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p><p>Must give us pause: there’s the respect</p><p>That makes calamity of so long life;</p><p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p><p>The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</p><p>The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,</p><p>The insolence of office and the spurns</p><p>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</p><p>When he himself might his quietus make</p><p>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,</p><p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p><p>But that the dread of something after death,</p><p>The undiscover’d country from whose bourn</p><p>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</p><p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p><p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p><p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</p><p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p><p>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</p><p>And enterprises of great pitch and moment</p><p>With this regard their currents turn awry,</p><p>And lose the name of action.\u2060—Soft you now!</p><p>The fair Ophelia!

I did love you once.</p><p>Ophelia—: Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</p><p>Hamlet—: You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you not.</p><p>Ophelia—: I was the more deceived.</p><p>Hamlet—: Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?</p><p>Ophelia—: At home, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in’s own house.

Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.</p><p>Ophelia—: O heavenly powers, restore him!</p><p>Hamlet—: I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nick-name God’s creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on’t; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.

Exeunt.</p><p></p><p>Scene II</p><p>A hall in the castle.</p><p></p><p>Enter Hamlet and Players.</p><p>Hamlet—: Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.</p><p>First Player—: I warrant your honour.</p><p>Hamlet—: Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</p><p>First Player—: I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.</p><p>Hamlet—: O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that’s villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready. Exeunt Players.</p><p>Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.</p><p>How now, my lord!

A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.</p><p>King—: How fares our cousin Hamlet?</p><p>Hamlet—: Excellent, i’ faith; of the chameleon’s dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.</p><p>King—: I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.</p><p>Hamlet—: No, nor mine now. To Polonius. My lord, you played once i’ the university, you say?</p><p>Polonius—: That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.</p><p>Hamlet—: What did you enact?</p><p>Polonius—: I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i’ the Capitol; Brutus killed me.</p><p>Hamlet—: It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.</p><p>Queen—: Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.</p><p>Hamlet—: No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.</p><p>Polonius—: To the King. O, ho! do you mark that?</p><p>Hamlet—: Lady, shall I lie in your lap? Lying down at Ophelia’s feet.</p><p>Ophelia—: No, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: I mean, my head upon your lap?</p><p>Ophelia—: Ay, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Do you think I meant country matters?</p><p>Ophelia—: I think nothing, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.</p><p>Ophelia—: What is, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: Nothing.</p><p>Ophelia—: You are merry, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Who, I?</p><p>Ophelia—: Ay, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.</p><p>Ophelia—: Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by’r lady, he must build churches, then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is “For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot.”</p><p>Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters.</p><p>Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King’s ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love. Exeunt.</p><p>Ophelia—: What means this, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.</p><p>Ophelia—: Belike this show imports the argument of the play.</p><p>Enter Prologue.</p><p>Hamlet—: We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they’ll tell all.</p><p>Ophelia—: Will he tell us what this show meant?</p><p>Hamlet—: Ay, or any show that you’ll show him: be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.</p><p>Ophelia—: You are naught, you are naught: I’ll mark the play.</p><p>Prologue—: </p><p>For us, and for our tragedy,</p><p>Here stooping to your clemency,</p><p>We beg your hearing patiently.

Is there no offence in’t?</p><p>Hamlet—: No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ the world.</p><p>King—: What do you call the play?</p><p>Hamlet—: The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke’s name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; ’tis a knavish piece of work: but what o’ that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.</p><p>Enter Lucianus.</p><p>This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.</p><p>Ophelia—: You are as good as a chorus, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.</p><p>Ophelia—: You are keen, my lord, you are keen.</p><p>Hamlet—: It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.</p><p>Ophelia—: Still better, and worse.</p><p>Hamlet—: So you must take your husbands.

But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration? Impart.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.</p><p>Hamlet—: We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: My lord, you once did love me.</p><p>Hamlet—: So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.</p><p>Hamlet—: Sir, I lack advancement.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?</p><p>Hamlet—: Ay, but sir, “While the grass grows,”\u2060—the proverb is something musty.</p><p>Reenter Players with recorders.</p><p>O, the recorders! let me see one.

Will you play upon this pipe?</p><p>Guildenstern—: My lord, I cannot.</p><p>Hamlet—: I pray you.</p><p>Guildenstern—: Believe me, I cannot.</p><p>Hamlet—: I do beseech you.</p><p>Guildenstern—: I know no touch of it, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: ’Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.</p><p>Guildenstern—: But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.</p><p>Hamlet—: Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. ’Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me.</p><p>Enter Polonius.</p><p>God bless you, sir!</p><p>Polonius—: My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.</p><p>Hamlet—: Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?</p><p>Polonius—: By the mass, and ’tis like a camel, indeed.</p><p>Hamlet—: Methinks it is like a weasel.</p><p>Polonius—: It is backed like a weasel.</p><p>Hamlet—: Or like a whale?</p><p>Polonius—: Very like a whale.</p><p>Hamlet—: Then I will come to my mother by and by.

Exeunt severally; Hamlet dragging in Polonius.</p><p></p><p>Act IV</p><p>Scene I</p><p>A room in the castle.</p><p></p><p>Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.</p><p>King—: </p><p>There’s matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:</p><p>You must translate: ’tis fit we understand them.</p><p>Where is your son?</p><p></p><p>Queen—: </p><p>Bestow this place on us a little while. Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p><p>Ah, mine good lord, what have I seen to-night!</p><p></p><p>King—: What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?</p><p>Queen—: </p><p>Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend</p><p>Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,</p><p>Behind the arras hearing something stir,</p><p>Whips out his rapier, cries, “A rat, a rat!”</p><p>And, in this brainish apprehension, kills</p><p>The unseen good old man.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>O heavy deed!</p><p>It had been so with us, had we been there:</p><p>His liberty is full of threats to all;</p><p>To you yourself, to us, to every one.</p><p>Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer’d?</p><p>It will be laid to us, whose providence</p><p>Should have kept short, restrain’d and out of haunt,</p><p>This mad young man: but so much was our love,</p><p>We would not understand what was most fit;</p><p>But, like the owner of a foul disease,</p><p>To keep it from divulging, let it feed</p><p>Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?</p><p></p><p>Queen—: </p><p>To draw apart the body he hath kill’d:</p><p>O’er whom his very madness, like some ore</p><p>Among a mineral of metals base,</p><p>Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>O Gertrude, come away!</p><p>The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,</p><p>But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed</p><p>We must, with all our majesty and skill,</p><p>Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!</p><p></p><p>Reenter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p><p>Friends both, go join you with some further aid:</p><p>Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,</p><p>And from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him:</p><p>Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body</p><p>Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this. Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p><p>Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends;</p><p>And let them know, both what we mean to do,</p><p>And what’s untimely done. So haply slander\u2060—2</p><p>Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,</p><p>As level as the canon to his blank,</p><p>Transports his poison’d shot, may miss our name,</p><p>And hit the woundless air. O, come away!</p><p>My soul is full of discord and dismay. Exeunt.</p><p></p><p>Scene II</p><p>Another room in the castle.</p><p></p><p>Enter Hamlet.</p><p>Hamlet—: Safely stowed.</p><p>Rosencrantz</p><p>Guildenstern—: Within. Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!</p><p>Hamlet—: But soft, what noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.</p><p>Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?</p><p>Hamlet—: Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: </p><p>Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence</p><p>And bear it to the chapel.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: Do not believe it.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Believe what?</p><p>Hamlet—: That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what replication should be made by the son of a king?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Take you me for a sponge, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: Ay, sir, that soaks up the king’s countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: I understand you not, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us to the king.</p><p>Hamlet—: The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body. The king is a thing\u2060—</p><p>Guildenstern—: A thing, my lord!</p><p>Hamlet—: Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after. Exeunt.</p><p>Scene III</p><p>Another room in the castle.</p><p></p><p>Enter King, attended.</p><p>King—: </p><p>I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.</p><p>How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!</p><p>Yet must not we put the strong law on him:</p><p>He’s loved of the distracted multitude,</p><p>Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes:</p><p>And where ’tis so, the offender’s scourge is weigh’d,</p><p>But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,</p><p>This sudden sending him away must seem</p><p>Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown</p><p>By desperate appliance are relieved,</p><p>Or not at all.</p><p></p><p>Enter Rosencrantz.</p><p>How now! what hath befall’n?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: </p><p>Where the dead body is bestow’d, my lord,</p><p>We cannot get from him.</p><p></p><p>King—: But where is he?</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.</p><p>King—: Bring him before us.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.</p><p>Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.</p><p>King—: Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?</p><p>Hamlet—: At supper.</p><p>King—: At supper! where?</p><p>Hamlet—: Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes, but to one table: that’s the end.</p><p>King—: Alas, alas!</p><p>Hamlet—: A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.</p><p>King—: What dost you mean by this?</p><p>Hamlet—: Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.</p><p>King—: Where is Polonius?</p><p>Hamlet—: In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i’ the other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.</p><p>King—: Go seek him there. To some Attendants.</p><p>Hamlet—: He will stay till ye come. Exeunt Attendants.</p><p>King—: </p><p>Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety\u2060—</p><p>Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve</p><p>For that which thou hast done\u2060—must send thee hence</p><p>With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;</p><p>The bark is ready, and the wind at help,</p><p>The associates tend, and every thing is bent</p><p>For England.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: For England!</p><p>King—: Ay, Hamlet.</p><p>Hamlet—: Good.</p><p>King—: So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.</p><p>Hamlet—: I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother.</p><p>King—: Thy loving father, Hamlet.</p><p>Hamlet—: My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England! Exit.</p><p>King—: </p><p>Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;</p><p>Delay it not; I’ll have him hence to-night:</p><p>Away! for every thing is seal’d and done</p><p>That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste. Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p><p>And, England, if my love thou hold’st at aught\u2060—</p><p>As my great power thereof may give thee sense,</p><p>Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red</p><p>After the Danish sword, and thy free awe</p><p>Pays homage to us\u2060—thou mayst not coldly set</p><p>Our sovereign process; which imports at full,</p><p>By letters congruing to that effect,</p><p>The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;</p><p>For like the hectic in my blood he rages,</p><p>And thou must cure me: till I know ’tis done,</p><p>Howe’er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun. Exit.</p><p></p><p>Scene IV</p><p>A plain in Denmark.</p><p></p><p>Enter Fortinbras, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching.</p><p>Prince Fortinbras—: </p><p>Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;</p><p>Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras</p><p>Craves the conveyance of a promised march</p><p>Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.</p><p>If that his majesty would aught with us,</p><p>We shall express our duty in his eye;</p><p>And let him know so.</p><p></p><p>Captain—: I will do’t, my lord.</p><p>Prince Fortinbras—: Go softly on. Exeunt Fortinbras and Soldiers.</p><p>Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.</p><p>Hamlet—: Good sir, whose powers are these?</p><p>Captain—: They are of Norway, sir.</p><p>Hamlet—: How purposed, sir, I pray you?</p><p>Captain—: Against some part of Poland.</p><p>Hamlet—: Who commands them, sir?</p><p>Captain—: The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,</p><p>Or for some frontier?</p><p></p><p>Captain—: </p><p>Truly to speak, and with no addition,</p><p>We go to gain a little patch of ground</p><p>That hath in it no profit but the name.</p><p>To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;</p><p>Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole</p><p>A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: Why, then the Polack never will defend it.</p><p>Captain—: Yes, it is already garrison’d.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats</p><p>Will not debate the question of this straw:</p><p>This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,</p><p>That inward breaks, and shows no cause without</p><p>Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.</p><p></p><p>Captain—: God be wi’ you, sir. Exit.</p><p>Rosencrantz—: Will’t please you go, my lord?</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before. Exeunt all except Hamlet.</p><p>How all occasions do inform against me,</p><p>And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,</p><p>If his chief good and market of his time</p><p>Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.</p><p>Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,</p><p>Looking before and after, gave us not</p><p>That capability and god-like reason</p><p>To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be</p><p>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</p><p>Of thinking too precisely on the event,</p><p>A thought which, quarter’d, hath but one part wisdom</p><p>And ever three parts coward, I do not know</p><p>Why yet I live to say “This thing’s to do;”</p><p>Sith I have cause and will and strength and means</p><p>To do’t.

There’s a letter for you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.</p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>Reads.</p><p></p><p>“Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.</p><p></p><p>“He that thou knowest thine, Hamlet.”</p><p></p><p>Come, I will make you way for these your letters;</p><p>And do’t the speedier, that you may direct me</p><p>To him from whom you brought them. Exeunt.</p><p></p><p>Scene VII</p><p>Another room in the castle.</p><p></p><p>Enter King and Laertes.</p><p>King—: </p><p>Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,</p><p>And you must put me in your heart for friend,</p><p>Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</p><p>That he which hath your noble father slain</p><p>Pursued my life.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>It well appears: but tell me</p><p>Why you proceeded not against these feats,</p><p>So crimeful and so capital in nature,</p><p>As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,</p><p>You mainly were stirr’d up.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>O, for two special reasons;</p><p>Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d,</p><p>But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother</p><p>Lives almost by his looks; and for myself\u2060—</p><p>My virtue or my plague, be it either which\u2060—</p><p>She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul,</p><p>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</p><p>I could not but by her. The other motive,</p><p>Why to a public count I might not go,</p><p>Is the great love the general gender bear him;</p><p>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</p><p>Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</p><p>Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,</p><p>Too slightly timber’d for so loud a wind,</p><p>Would have reverted to my bow again,</p><p>And not where I had aim’d them.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>And so have I a noble father lost;</p><p>A sister driven into desperate terms,</p><p>Whose worth, if praises may go back again,</p><p>Stood challenger on mount of all the age</p><p>For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think</p><p>That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</p><p>That we can let our beard be shook with danger</p><p>And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:</p><p>I loved your father, and we love ourself;</p><p>And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine\u2060—</p><p></p><p>Enter a Messenger.</p><p>How now! what news?</p><p>Messenger—: </p><p>Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:</p><p>This to your majesty; this to the queen.</p><p></p><p>King—: From Hamlet! who brought them?</p><p>Messenger—: </p><p>Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:</p><p>They were given me by Claudio; he received them</p><p>Of him that brought them.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us. Exit Messenger.</p><p></p><p>Reads.</p><p></p><p>“High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet.”</p><p></p><p>What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?</p><p>Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: Know you the hand?</p><p>King—: </p><p>’Tis Hamlet’s character. “Naked!”</p><p>And in a postscript here, he says “alone.”</p><p>Can you advise me?</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>I’m lost in it, my lord. But let him come;</p><p>It warms the very sickness in my heart,</p><p>That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,</p><p>“Thus didest thou.”</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>If it be so, Laertes\u2060—</p><p>As how should it be so? how otherwise?\u2060—</p><p>Will you be ruled by me?</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>Ay, my lord;</p><p>So you will not o’errule me to a peace.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>To thine own peace. If he be now return’d,</p><p>As checking at his voyage, and that he means</p><p>No more to undertake it, I will work him</p><p>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</p><p>Under the which he shall not choose but fall:</p><p>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</p><p>But even his mother shall uncharge the practice</p><p>And call it accident.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>My lord, I will be ruled;</p><p>The rather, if you could devise it so</p><p>That I might be the organ.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>It falls right.</p><p>You have been talk’d of since your travel much,</p><p>And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality</p><p>Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts</p><p>Did not together pluck such envy from him</p><p>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</p><p>Of the unworthiest siege.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: What part is that, my lord?</p><p>King—: </p><p>A very riband in the cap of youth,</p><p>Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes</p><p>The light and careless livery that it wears</p><p>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</p><p>Importing health and graveness. Two months since,</p><p>Here was a gentleman of Normandy:\u2060—</p><p>I’ve seen myself, and served against, the French,</p><p>And they can well on horseback: but this gallant</p><p>Had witchcraft in’t; he grew unto his seat;</p><p>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</p><p>As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</p><p>With the brave beast: so far he topp’d my thought,</p><p>That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,</p><p>Come short of what he did.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: A Norman was’t?</p><p>King—: A Norman.</p><p>Laertes—: Upon my life, Lamond.</p><p>King—: The very same.</p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>I know him well: he is the brooch indeed</p><p>And gem of all the nation.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>He made confession of you,</p><p>And gave you such a masterly report</p><p>For art and exercise in your defence</p><p>And for your rapier most especial,</p><p>That he cried out, ’twould be a sight indeed,</p><p>If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,</p><p>He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</p><p>If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his</p><p>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</p><p>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</p><p>Your sudden coming o’er, to play with him.</p><p>Now, out of this\u2060—</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: What out of this, my lord?</p><p>King—: </p><p>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</p><p>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</p><p>A face without a heart?</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: Why ask you this?</p><p>King—: </p><p>Not that I think you did not love your father;</p><p>But that I know love is begun by time;</p><p>And that I see, in passages of proof,</p><p>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</p><p>There lives within the very flame of love</p><p>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;</p><p>And nothing is at a like goodness still;</p><p>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</p><p>Dies in his own too much: that we would do,</p><p>We should do when we would; for this “would” changes</p><p>And hath abatements and delays as many</p><p>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</p><p>And then this “should” is like a spendthrift sigh,</p><p>That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o’ the ulcer:\u2060—</p><p>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,</p><p>To show yourself your father’s son in deed</p><p>More than in words?</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: To cut his throat i’ the church.</p><p>King—: </p><p>No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;</p><p>Revenge should have no bounds.

For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.</p><p>Second Clown—: Nay, but hear you, goodman delver\u2060—</p><p>First Clown—: Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes\u2060—mark you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</p><p>Second Clown—: But is this law?</p><p>First Clown—: Ay, marry, is’t; crowner’s quest law.</p><p>Second Clown—: Will you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial.</p><p>First Clown—: Why, there thou say’st: and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam’s profession.</p><p>Second Clown—: Was he a gentleman?</p><p>First Clown—: A’ was the first that ever bore arms.</p><p>Second Clown—: Why, he had none.</p><p>First Clown—: What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says “Adam digged:” could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself\u2060—</p><p>Second Clown—: Go to.</p><p>First Clown—: What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?</p><p>Second Clown—: The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.</p><p>First Clown—: I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well; but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee.

It might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o’er-reaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not?</p><p>Horatio—: It might, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Or of a courtier; which could say “Good morrow, sweet lord!

Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?</p><p>Horatio—: Not a jot more, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Is not parchment made of sheepskins?</p><p>Horatio—: Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.</p><p>Hamlet—: They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that.

By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe. How long hast thou been a grave-maker?</p><p>First Clown—: Of all the days i’ the year, I came to’t that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.</p><p>Hamlet—: How long is that since?</p><p>First Clown—: Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that is mad, and sent into England.</p><p>Hamlet—: Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?</p><p>First Clown—: Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, it’s no great matter there.</p><p>Hamlet—: Why?</p><p>First Clown—: ’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.</p><p>Hamlet—: How came he mad?</p><p>First Clown—: Very strangely, they say.</p><p>Hamlet—: How strangely?</p><p>First Clown—: Faith, e’en with losing his wits.</p><p>Hamlet—: Upon what ground?</p><p>First Clown—: Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.</p><p>Hamlet—: How long will a man lie i’ the earth ere he rot?</p><p>First Clown—: I’ faith, if he be not rotten before he die\u2060—as we have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in\u2060—he will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.</p><p>Hamlet—: Why he more than another?</p><p>First Clown—: Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that he will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here’s a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth three and twenty years.</p><p>Hamlet—: Whose was it?</p><p>First Clown—: A whoreson mad fellow’s it was: whose do you think it was?</p><p>Hamlet—: Nay, I know not.</p><p>First Clown—: A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a’ poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.

I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that.

Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole?</p><p>Horatio—: ’Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?</p><p></p><p>Imperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay,</p><p>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:</p><p>O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,</p><p>Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!</p><p>But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king,</p><p></p><p>Enter Priests, etc. in procession; the Corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their trains, etc.</p><p>The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?</p><p>And with such maimed rites?

Dost know this water-fly?</p><p>Horatio—: No, my good lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess: ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.</p><p>Osric—: Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.</p><p>Hamlet—: I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for the head.</p><p>Osric—: I thank your lordship, it is very hot.</p><p>Hamlet—: No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the wind is northerly.</p><p>Osric—: It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</p><p>Hamlet—: But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.</p><p>Osric—: Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry\u2060—as ’twere\u2060—I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter\u2060—</p><p>Hamlet—: I beseech you, remember\u2060—Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.</p><p>Osric—: Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.</p><p>Hamlet—: Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.</p><p>Osric—: Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</p><p>Hamlet—: The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?</p><p>Osric—: Sir?</p><p>Horatio—: Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do’t, sir, really.</p><p>Hamlet—: What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</p><p>Osric—: Of Laertes?</p><p>Horatio—: His purse is empty already; all’s golden words are spent.</p><p>Hamlet—: Of him, sir.</p><p>Osric—: I know you are not ignorant\u2060—</p><p>Hamlet—: I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</p><p>Osric—: You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is\u2060—</p><p>Hamlet—: I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.</p><p>Osric—: I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he’s unfellowed.</p><p>Hamlet—: What’s his weapon?</p><p>Osric—: Rapier and dagger.</p><p>Hamlet—: That’s two of his weapons: but, well.</p><p>Osric—: The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.</p><p>Hamlet—: What call you the carriages?</p><p>Horatio—: I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</p><p>Osric—: The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</p><p>Hamlet—: The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this “imponed,” as you call it?</p><p>Osric—: The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.</p><p>Hamlet—: How if I answer “no”?</p><p>Osric—: I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</p><p>Hamlet—: Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</p><p>Osric—: Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?</p><p>Hamlet—: To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.</p><p>Osric—: I commend my duty to your lordship.</p><p>Hamlet—: Yours, yours. Exit Osric. He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for’s turn.</p><p>Horatio—: This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.</p><p>Hamlet—: He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it. Thus has he\u2060—and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on\u2060—only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.</p><p>Enter a Lord.</p><p>Lord—: My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.</p><p>Hamlet—: I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king’s pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.</p><p>Lord—: The king and queen and all are coming down.</p><p>Hamlet—: In happy time.</p><p>Lord—: The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.</p><p>Hamlet—: She well instructs me. Exit Lord.</p><p>Horatio—: You will lose this wager, my lord.</p><p>Hamlet—: I do not think so: since he went into France, I have been in continual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart: but it is no matter.</p><p>Horatio—: Nay, good my lord\u2060—</p><p>Hamlet—: It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.</p><p>Horatio—: If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit.</p><p>Hamlet—: Not a whit, we defy augury: there’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes?</p><p>Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with foils, etc.</p><p>King—: Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.</p><p>The King puts Laertes’ hand into Hamlet’s.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Give me your pardon, sir: I’ve done you wrong;</p><p>But pardon’t, as you are a gentleman.</p><p>This presence knows,</p><p>And you must needs have heard, how I am punish’d</p><p>With sore distraction. What I have done,</p><p>That might your nature, honour and exception</p><p>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.</p><p>Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet:</p><p>If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,</p><p>And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,</p><p>Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.</p><p>Who does it, then?

But till that time,</p><p>I do receive your offer’d love like love,</p><p>And will not wrong it.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>I embrace it freely;</p><p>And will this brother’s wager frankly play.</p><p>Give us the foils. Come on.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: Come, one for me.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>I’ll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance</p><p>Your skill shall, like a star i’ the darkest night,</p><p>Stick fiery off indeed.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: You mock me, sir.</p><p>Hamlet—: No, by this hand.</p><p>King—: </p><p>Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,</p><p>You know the wager?</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Very well, my lord;</p><p>Your grace hath laid the odds o’ the weaker side.</p><p></p><p>King—: </p><p>I do not fear it; I have seen you both:</p><p>But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: This is too heavy, let me see another.</p><p>Hamlet—: This likes me well. These foils have all a length? They prepare to play.</p><p>Osric—: Ay, my good lord.</p><p>King—: </p><p>Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.</p><p>If Hamlet give the first or second hit,</p><p>Or quit in answer of the third exchange,</p><p>Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;</p><p>The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath;</p><p>And in the cup an union shall he throw,</p><p>Richer than that which four successive kings</p><p>In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups;</p><p>And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,</p><p>The trumpet to the cannoneer without,</p><p>The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,</p><p>“Now the king drinks to Hamlet.” Come, begin:</p><p>And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: Come on, sir.</p><p>Laertes—: Come, my lord. They play.</p><p>Hamlet—: One.</p><p>Laertes—: No.</p><p>Hamlet—: Judgment.</p><p>Osric—: A hit, a very palpable hit.</p><p>Laertes—: Well; again.</p><p>King—: </p><p>Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;</p><p>Here’s to thy health. Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within. Give him the cup.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: I’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come. They play. Another hit; what say you?</p><p>Laertes—: A touch, a touch, I do confess.</p><p>King—: Our son shall win.</p><p>Queen—: </p><p>He’s fat, and scant of breath.</p><p>Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:</p><p>The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: Good madam!</p><p>King—: Gertrude, do not drink.</p><p>Queen—: I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.</p><p>King—: Aside. It is the poison’d cup: it is too late.</p><p>Hamlet—: I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.</p><p>Queen—: Come, let me wipe thy face.</p><p>Laertes—: My lord, I’ll hit him now.</p><p>King—: I do not think’t.</p><p>Laertes—: Aside. And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;</p><p>I pray you, pass with your best violence;</p><p>I am afeard you make a wanton of me.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: Say you so? come on. They play.</p><p>Osric—: Nothing, neither way.</p><p>Laertes—: Have at you now! Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.</p><p>King—: Part them; they are incensed.</p><p>Hamlet—: Nay, come, again. The Queen falls.</p><p>Osric—: Look to the queen there, ho!</p><p>Horatio—: They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?</p><p>Osric—: How is’t, Laertes?</p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;</p><p>I am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: How does the queen?</p><p>King—: She swounds to see them bleed.</p><p>Queen—: </p><p>No, no, the drink, the drink\u2060—O my dear Hamlet\u2060—</p><p>The drink, the drink! I am poison’d. Dies.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>O villany! Ho! let the door be lock’d:</p><p>Treachery! Seek it out.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;</p><p>No medicine in the world can do thee good;</p><p>In thee there is not half an hour of life;</p><p>The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,</p><p>Unbated and envenom’d: the foul practice</p><p>Hath turn’d itself on me; lo, here I lie,</p><p>Never to rise again: thy mother’s poison’d:</p><p>I can no more: the king, the king’s to blame.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>The point envenom’d too!</p><p>Then, venom, to thy work. Stabs the King.</p><p></p><p>All—: Treason! treason!</p><p>King—: O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.</p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,</p><p>Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?</p><p>Follow my mother. King dies.</p><p></p><p>Laertes—: </p><p>He is justly served;</p><p>It is a poison temper’d by himself.</p><p>Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:</p><p>Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee,</p><p>Nor thine on me! Dies.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.</p><p>I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!</p><p>You that look pale and tremble at this chance,</p><p>That are but mutes or audience to this act,</p><p>Had I but time\u2060—as this fell sergeant, death,</p><p>Is strict in his arrest\u2060—O, I could tell you\u2060—</p><p>But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;</p><p>Thou livest; report me and my cause aright</p><p>To the unsatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>Never believe it:</p><p>I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:</p><p>Here’s yet some liquor left.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>As thou’rt a man,</p><p>Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I’ll have’t.</p><p>O good Horatio, what a wounded name,</p><p>Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!</p><p>If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,</p><p>Absent thee from felicity awhile,</p><p>And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,</p><p>To tell my story. March afar off, and shot within. What warlike noise is this?</p><p></p><p>Osric—: </p><p>Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,</p><p>To the ambassadors of England gives</p><p>This warlike volley.</p><p></p><p>Hamlet—: </p><p>O, I die, Horatio;</p><p>The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit:</p><p>I cannot live to hear the news from England;</p><p>But I do prophesy the election lights</p><p>On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;</p><p>So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,</p><p>Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Dies.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince;</p><p>And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!</p><p>Why does the drum come hither? March within.</p><p></p><p>Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors, and others.</p><p>Prince Fortinbras—: Where is this sight?</p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>What is it ye would see?</p><p>If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</p><p></p><p>Prince Fortinbras—: </p><p>This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,</p><p>What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,</p><p>That thou so many princes at a shot</p><p>So bloodily hast struck?</p><p></p><p>First Ambassador—: </p><p>The sight is dismal;</p><p>And our affairs from England come too late:</p><p>The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,</p><p>To tell him his commandment is fulfill’d,</p><p>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:</p><p>Where should we have our thanks?</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>Not from his mouth,</p><p>Had it the ability of life to thank you:</p><p>He never gave commandment for their death.</p><p>But since, so jump upon this bloody question,</p><p>You from the Polack wars, and you from England,</p><p>Are here arrived give order that these bodies</p><p>High on a stage be placed to the view;</p><p>And let me speak to the yet unknowing world</p><p>How these things came about: so shall you hear</p><p>Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,</p><p>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,</p><p>Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,</p><p>And, in this upshot, purposes mistook</p><p>Fall’n on the inventors’ heads: all this can I</p><p>Truly deliver.</p><p></p><p>Prince Fortinbras—: </p><p>Let us haste to hear it,</p><p>And call the noblest to the audience.</p><p>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:</p><p>I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,</p><p>Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</p><p></p><p>Horatio—: </p><p>Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</p><p>And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:</p><p>But let this same be presently perform’d,</p><p>Even while men’s minds are wild; lest more mischance,</p><p>On plots and errors, happen.</p><p></p><p>Prince Fortinbras—: </p><p>Let four captains</p><p>Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;</p><p>For he was likely, had he been put on,</p><p>To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,</p><p>The soldiers’ music and the rites of war</p><p>Speak loudly for him.</p><p>Take up the bodies: such a sight as this</p><p>Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.</p><p>Go, bid the soldiers shoot. A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off.</p><p></p><p>Endnotes</p><p>In an effort to create a complete form of Hamlet, William George Clark and William Aldis Wright combined parts of Hamlet from both the Second Quarto and First Folio. This portion of dialogue originates from the Second Quarto but the verse line is missing a word. The printing of the Second Quarto skips a word making the line read “And either the devil, or throw him out.” Shakespeare’s original intent has been lost, and modern scholars have a variety of theories on what it might have been. Scholars have proposed “master” as a possible emendation. Other guesses made by scholars include “curb,” “lodge,” “reign,” and “seize.” —\u2060Emma Sweeney ↩</p><p></p><p>Here we encounter another complication due to combining two versions of Hamlet. In the First Folio, the text is missing almost four lines of verse. These lines have been restored from the Second Quarto but the print was not perfect: a portion of a verse line was not completed. Scholars have proposed “So haply slander\u2060—” as a possible emendation. Another guess made by scholars is “So dreaded slander\u2060—.” —\u2060Emma Sweeney ↩</p>",
